# Introduction to Research Computing

In this course we will introduce you to the basic concepts and best practices required to produce high quality, maintainable code for research.  The majority of the code will be in the python language as it has a very simple structure and is simple to learn as it comes with two interactive enviroments, jupyter and ipython, where code can be developed.  It presents a nice halfway house between high level applications like Mathematica and Matlab; and low level compiled codes like C, C++ and Fortran. Python is also currently the number one skill companies require for data science jobs and is the default language for most machine learing so is a very valuable skill outside of academia too.

The goal of this course it not to teach you everything you need to know to become an ninja programmer.  This is impossible, the collection of notes I am using to help create this course contain over 850 pages just for python. The goal is simply to provide the framework for you to learn on your own as you work on whatever coding problems you face in your research.

At the end of this course you should understand how to write code in a stuctured way so that the code is understandable, maintainable and efficent.  You should also understand how to write you code so that it can run on a range of architectures from laptops to clusters to supercomputers.
