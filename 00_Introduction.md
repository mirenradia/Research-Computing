# Research Computing for Data Intensive Science

In this course we will introduce you to the basic concepts and best practices required to produce high quality, maintainable code for research. This course has been designed in response to the emerging challenges driven by the increasing size and complexity of scientific data sets and the need to collaborate with large teams to analyse them.  The skills learn here will also be useful for those working on smaller projects or even alone.  The course will also seek to reduce the strong reputation scientist have in industry of having very very poor coding practice.  Most of the companies I talk to say it takes about 6 months to retrain academic hires before they can be useful.

The majority of the code will be in the python language as it has a very simple structure and is simple to learn as it comes with two interactive enviroments, jupyter and ipython, where code can be developed.  It presents a nice halfway house between high level applications, like Mathematica and Matlab; and low level compiled codes like C, C++ and Fortran. Python is also currently the number one skill companies require for data science jobs and is the default language for most machine learing so is a very valuable skill outside of academia too.

While the course is mostly in Python, this is not a Python course.  The goal of this course is instead to teach you the skills required to develop code in any language using the best practices and tools available.  Nor is this a course deisgned to create "ninja" programmers.  This is impossible for several reasons.  Firstly, the collection of notes I am using to help create this course contain over 850 pages just for python alone so to get to all the detail in any of the areas we cover would be a full course in itself. The main reason however, is that no course can make you a "ninja". Coding is a practical skill you can only master with experience much like wood-working or knitting.  In order to learn to code you simply have to do it while alwys seeking to improve.

Instead, the goal of this course is to discuss how you should approach software development (and why you should think of it as software develpment rather than coding) and to provide you an introduction to what professional software development looks like and how to design your projects to incoporate the principles of open science.  Everything you learn here is applicable to any language, not just python, and we will discuss other languages as we go.  Each lecture will only provide an broad introduction to the area with the goal of providing the framework for you to get started then learn more on your own.  Expereince shows that the fasted way to learn most topics is simply to attempt to do them supported by frequent googling.  

At the end of this course you should understand:
- How to write code in a stuctured way so that the code is understandable, maintainable and shareable by using modern software development best practice.
