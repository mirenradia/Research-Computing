For the code calculating the integral in the previous notebook you may want to to create tests that check you polynomials are OK (by checking orthonormality) or that the final integral with Gauss-Legendre quadriture is correct for large l (ie set X = $\\delta_{l,200}$ and see if you get the correct answer, 0.000018285996687338485).  \n",

Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests.  This stops people from introducing errors which are not found until much later as the code must pass all tests before it can be accepted into the main repository.\n",

You can run it localy on your machine or via the cloud.  Most will create multiple virtual machines so you can test on multiple versions of python simultaneously to ensure code stability and most have free options.  Setting these up can be a bit tricky so one of the easiest options is to use the CI tools built into the popular GIT hosting sites. `github`, `gitlab`, and `bitbucket` all have the tools built in and template scripts you can use.\n",

Now your main branch is safe and can't be commited to.   without all testing passing.  This is a fairly basic CI setup which works fine for very small teams but there are a huge number of options.  The documentation is mostly OK once you have the basics so you can teach yourself but if you want to create CI for a medium size team (3+) it might be best to ask for some computer officer support.  That said, the tools for managing it are advancing rapidly so it's worth exploring what is available regularly."
